question 1:
1. Do you agree with CO2 level claims? Use CO2 Data Set 1 to analyze CO2 changes.

a. Do you agree that the March 2004 increase of CO2 resulted in a larger increase than
observed over any previous 10-year period? Why or why not?
(Tianyi's analysis on Excel)

b. Fit various (more than one) mathematical models to the data to describe past, and predict
future, concentration levels of CO2 in the atmosphere.
(linear, quadratic, exponential)
(grey box)
(neural network)

c. Use each of your models to predict the CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere in the year
2100. Do any of your models agree with claims and predictions that the CO2 concentration
level will reach 685 ppm by 2050? If not by 2050, when do your models predict the
concentration of CO2 reaching 685 ppm?
(follow above models)

d. Which model do you consider most accurate? Why?
(statistical analysis? idk)
